## Continuous integration Environment Project
 Set up a continuous integration (CI) environment that can build the software project and execute tests automatically. The environment shall respond to developer code pushes and from push, build the entire system and run, at least, unit and integration test cases but preferably system tests.
 
The environment must include:
- An integrated development environment (e.g. Eclipse or intellij IDEA)
- A version control software (e.g. SVN, SourceTree or EGit plugin for Eclipse)
- A version control server (e.g. Bitbucket or Github)
- A continuous integration (CI) tool (e.g. Jenkins)
- An automated build tool that connects to the CI tool (e.g. Maven or Ant)
- An automated test framework for AT LEAST unit and integration tests (e.g. XUnit)
- (optional) A system test tool (e.g. EyeAutomate or Selenium)
